'''
A number is said to be an automorphic number if the given number appears in the end of the squared number.
ex :- n = 6
6 * 6 = 36
if we square the given number then the last digit is same as the given number. so 6 is an automorphic number.

ex 2:- n = 5
5 * 5 = 25
so 5 is an automorphic number.

ex 3:- n = 25
25 * 25 = 625
here 25 is an automorphic number.
